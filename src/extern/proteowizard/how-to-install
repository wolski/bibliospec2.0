How to install Proteowizard for BiblioSpec on Linux

1. Check out the proteowizard project anywhere.

$ svn checkout https://proteowizard.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/proteowizard/trunk/pwiz .

2. Build proteowizard using the quickbuild.sh script.

3. Install the libraries and header files with this command

$ ./quickbuild.sh libraries --prefix=<path to blib root>/src/extern/proteowizard/install

That should place libraries in install/lib and headers in install/include.  The critical
libraries are the following:

libboost_filesystem-gcc44-mt-s.a
libboost_iostreams-gcc44-mt-s.a
libboost_regex-gcc44-mt-s.a
libboost_system-gcc44-mt-s.a
libboost_thread-gcc44-mt-s.a
libpwiz_data_common.a
libpwiz_data_misc.a
libpwiz_data_msdata.a
libpwiz_data_msdata_version.a
libpwiz_utility_minimxml.a
libpwiz_utility_misc.a
libz-gcc44-mt-s-1_2.a

*NOTE that 'gcc44' will be replaced with whatever compiler version you 
are using.

4. Update <bibliospec>/src/c/makefile to have the correct names of the boost 
libaries.  For example, replace 'gcc44' with the compiler version on your 
system.  Until the pwiz install feature strips the toolset version from the
library names, the makefile may have to be altered to link to the correct 
library names.

How to install Proteowizard for BiblioSpec on Windows

The pre-built libraries are stored in the SVN repository, so nothing need be 
done until you need tu update the version of proteowizard being used.  In that
case...

1. Check out the proteowizard project anywhere.

2. Build proteowizard in DOS window using the quickbuild.bat script and the 
debug option.

3. Install the libraries and header files with this command

$ quickbuild.bat libraries --libdir=<path to blib>\win\lib --includedir=<path to blib>\src\extern\proteowizard\install\include

4. Rename the libpwiz_* libraries so that they end with -gd.lib, indicating 
they are the debug versions.

5. Build proteowizard again, this time in release mode.

6. Repeat the install step (3).  This time there is no need to rename the 
libraries.
