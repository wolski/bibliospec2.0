BiblioSpec 2.0

Installation Instructions

These instructions are for building the BiblioSpec tools from the download
package bibliospec-2.0.X.tgz where X is the specific revision number.  Check 
the website for pre-built tools for your platform before deciding to build 
from scratch.  First unpack the file into any directory.  

  tar -zxf bibliospec-2.0.X.tgz

These instructions will refer to this directory as BLIB_ROOT.

Building in Linux -----------------------------------------------------------

You will need the build tools 'make' and 'gcc', which are commonly installed
on many Linux distributions.  You will also need the Proteowizard library,
which can be downloaded from the BiblioSpec website.  Begin by creating a 
directory for proteowizard and unpacking it.

  tar -jxf pwiz-src-without-tv-2_1_2324.tar.bz2 

Build and install Proteowizard into the BiblioSpec directory structure in one
step
 
  ./quickbuild.sh libraries --prefix=BLIB_ROOT/src/extern/proteowizard/install

Confirm that the build was successful by looking for the archive files in
BLIB_ROOT/src/extern/proteowizard/install/lib/.  Note that the boost libraries
include the name of the toolset used to build them.  If these do not match
the names in the makefile, you will have to update it.  For example, if you see

  BLIB_ROOT/src/extern/proteowizard/install/lib/libboost_filesystem-gcc43-mt-s.a

you will need to edit the file BLIB_ROOT/src/c/makefile.  Look for 
'-lboost_filesystem-gcc44-mt-s' and change '44' to '43'.

Next, navigate to the directory BLIB_ROOT/src/c and build with the command

  make

Once it has finished, the executables will be in BLIB_ROOT/bin/.  You can run 
them from there or move them to some location in your $PATH.

Building in Windows ---------------------------------------------------------

BiblioSpec is built in Windows using Visual Studio 2010.  It may or may not
be compatible with older versions.  First you must unpack the files in
BLIB_ROOT/src/extern/program-options/boost_1_43_0.tgz.  If you have Cygwin
installed, you can use the tar utility
  
  cd BLIB_ROOT/src/extern/program-options/
  tar -zxf boost_1_43_0.tgz

Or you can use another program such as 7-Zip to unpack it.

Open the BiblioSpec.sln file in Visual Studio and build the solution.  The
executable files will be located in BLIB_ROOT/bin/Release or 
BLIB_ROOT/bin/Debug, depending on the configuration.
